Model information

test3 - A model with nu only. 
anti3 - A model with nu/nubar only.
tau3 - A model with all neutrinos

test3c - convection / nu only
anti3c - convection / nu and nubar
tau3c - convection / all neutrinos

test3nd - A model with nu only but no downscattering

test5/anti5/tau5 are models with different initial zoning.  These
models tend to break because the zoning near the shock is not
sufficient during the time of interest.

test3nr - A neutrino only model in which the adaptive meshing is
turned off
